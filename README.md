# The Range #

So this is my personal website + also project site. I like it; it's nice. It's pretty simple right now, but that's cool too. You can see what it looks like [here](www.gastove.com)

## Build & Run ##

```sh
$ cd The_Range
$ ./sbt
> container:start
> browse
```

If `browse` doesn't launch your browser, manually open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.
