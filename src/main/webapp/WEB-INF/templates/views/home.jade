    ### Hello!
    It's the Internet; this is a profile! And some links? Eh? Eh?  

    I'm a data scientist and hacker. I live in Oakland, California; I work in tech. I crunch numbers and swear swears, and then I take a break from numbers to have a drink and read. I write Many Codes, and backpack many places, but I only ride one bicycle at a time.  

    I'm currently figuring out this site; it's developing quickly, so check back periodically. While I'm working on that, you might want to read more [about me](/about), or checkout my [github](http://www.github.com/Gastove). I've also got a [blog](http://blog.gastove.com); it's very pleased to meet you.
